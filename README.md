# **Variables, Strings, and Numbers**
Welcome to this foundational collection of Python projects showcasing core programming concepts, with projects that highlight: 
| **Concept**       | **Definition**                                   | **Example**                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Variable**      | A named storage for data that can change.       | `name = "Anthony"`                   |
| **String**        | A sequence of text enclosed in quotes.          | `"Hello, World!"`                    |
| **Integer (int)** | A whole number without decimals.                | `age = 28`                           |
| **Float (float)** | A number with a decimal point.                  | `price = 19.06`                      |
| **Comment**       | Text ignored by Python to explain the code.     | `# This calculates the area`         |
| **Input (input)** | Lets you ask the user for information.          | `name = input("What's your name?")`  |
| **Output (print)**| Displays text or data to the user.              | `print("Hello, World weclome to my GitHub!")`             |

<h2>ðŸ“šVariables</h2>

This project is a simple demonstration on how to:
- Declare and print a variable.
- Update a variable and see the changes immediately.
- Use print statements to provide feedback to the user.

<h2>ðŸ“šStrings</h2>

This section includes a collection of beginner-friendly exercises that demonstrate various string operations in Python. Strings are a fundamental part of programming and are used to store and manipulate text data. In this section I show examples on how to:
- Use string methods like .upper(), .lower(), .title() for formatting.
- Combine strings dynamically with concatenation and f-strings.
- Handle whitespace using methods like .strip(), .rstrip(), and .lstrip().

<h3>- Personal Message</h3>
Description: Use a variable to store a person's name and print a personalized message for them.

<h3>- Name Cases</h3>
Description: Use a variable to store a name and display it in lowercase, uppercase, and title case.

<h3>- Famous Quote</h3>
Description: In this exercise we will print a famous quote along with the name of its author. Then we will repeat the exercise using variables. The authorâ€™s name will be stored in a variable called famous_person, and the quote will be stored in a separate variable called message. 

1.)

<h3>- Stripping Names</h3>
Description: This exercise demonstrates how to clean up extra whitespace in strings. We will work with a name containing tabs "\t" and newlines "\n" and use .strip(), .rstrip(), and .lstrip() to remove unwanted spaces and format the text properly.

<h2>ðŸ“šNumbers</h2>

Numbers are a fundamental part of programming and are used for performing calculations, storing numerical data, and creating dynamic outputs. In this section I show examples of how to:
- Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Use variables to store and work with numbers

<h3>- Number 8</h3>
Description: This exercise demonstrates basic arithmetic operations. I go over addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8.
