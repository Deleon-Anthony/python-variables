# **Variables, Strings, Numbers, and Comments**
Welcome to this foundational collection of Python projects showcasing core programming concepts, with projects that highlight: 
| **Concept**       | **Definition**                                   | **Example**                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|

<h2>ðŸ“šVariables</h2>

This project is a simple demonstration on how to:
1. Declare and print a variable.
2. Update a variable and see the changes immediately.
3. Use print statements to provide feedback to the user.

<h2>ðŸ“šStrings</h2>

This section includes a collection of beginner-friendly exercises that demonstrate various string operations in Python. Strings are a fundamental part of programming and are used to store and manipulate text data. In this section I show examples on how to:
- Use string methods like .upper(), .lower(), .title() for formatting.
- Combine strings dynamically with concatenation and f-strings.
- Handle whitespace using methods like .strip(), .rstrip(), and .lstrip().

<h3>- Personal Message</h3>

<h3>- Famous Quote</h3>
Description: In this exercise we will print a famous quote along with the name of its author. Then we will repeat the exercise using variables. The authorâ€™s name will be stored in a variable called famous_person, and the quote will be stored in a separate variable called message.
